# project_face_detection_and_cover


Python program to detect a face and track it while covering it with a blue rectangle.
Sometimes the rectangle gives a false positive, then you could cover the webcam with your finger and uncover it so that the rectangle detects your face.
best use with a smooth background(not a lot of stuff in the background)
made it so that when it doesn't detect anything, it will turn the background red.
have fun :)
